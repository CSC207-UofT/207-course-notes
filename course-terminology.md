# Version control and Java Basics

version control
* Teams of programmers use *version control* to manage changes to source code over time.

repository, git, add, commit, push, pull, clone, fork, "branch-and-merge workflow", pull request
* A repository is a directory that contains your project work, as well as a few files (hidden by default) which are used to communicate with Git.
