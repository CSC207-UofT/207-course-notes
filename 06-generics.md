# Chapter 6: Generics

Generics are a way for programmers to generalize the type that a class
or method works with.
They allow us to reuse the same code for various input types without needing to
cast things constantly.

For example, consider the `List<T>` interface built into Java. This interface
specifies what it means for a class to store a list of objects of a generic type `T`.
When we declare a variable to refer to a list of integers,
we specify the type as `List<Integer>`.

Here is a quick example working with generics:
```java
// note we don't need <Integer> on the right since it is implicit
ArrayList<Integer> ma = new ArrayList<>();
ma.add(1);
Integer my_item = ma.get(0) + 5;
```
The `<Integer>` specifies that we're working with an `ArrayList` containing
only Integers: we don't need to do any casting.

For our purposes, we'll primarily be making use of existing code that is written
using generics, like `ArrayList<T>` above. It is also possible to include generics
in your own custom classes, as described next, but this typically won't be necessary in this course.

## 6.1. Custom Generic Classes

Briefly, the syntax to define a generic class is as follows:

```java
public class Box<T> {
    private T item;

    public void set(T item) {
        this.item = item;
    }

    public T get() {
        return item;
    }
}
```

In this example:

- `Box<T>` is a generic class where `T` is a type parameter.
- You can create instances of `Box` for different types,
  like `Box<Integer>` or `Box<String>`.
- The type `T` is replaced with the actual type when the class is instantiated.

Example usage of our generic class might look like:

```java
Box<Integer> intBox = new Box<>();
intBox.set(123);
Integer value = intBox.get();

Box<String> strBox = new Box<>();
strBox.set("Hello");
String text = strBox.get();
```

## 6.2. bounded type parameters

You can also **restrict** the types that can be used with a generic class
or method using **bounded type parameters**. This is useful when your code
relies on certain behaviors or interfaces being available.

For example, Java’s `Collections.sort()` method requires that the elements
in the list implement the `Comparable` interface, so that they can be ordered.

Here’s how you might define a generic method that sorts a list of items that
are guaranteed to be comparable:

```java
public static <T extends Comparable<T>> void sortList(List<T> list) {
    Collections.sort(list);
}
```

In this example:
- `<T extends Comparable<T>>` means that `T` must be a type that
  implements `Comparable<T>`.
- This ensures that the `sortList` method can safely call `compareTo()` on
  elements of the list.

If you try to call `sortList()` with a type that doesn’t implement `Comparable`,
you’ll get a compile-time error. This is exactly what generics are designed
to help prevent.

It turns out that our `sortList()` is actually _slightly_ more restrictive than it
needs to be. If we look at the signature for `Collections.sort`, it is actually:

```java
public static <T extends Comparable<? super T>> void sort(List<T> list)
```

The `<T extends Comparable<? super T>>` part means that `T` must be a type that
can be compared to itself **or any of its supertypes**.

The `?` is a wildcard that stands for an unknown type. In `Comparable<? super T>`,
it means we don’t care exactly what the type is — only that it is a supertype of T.
This allows the method to work with a wider range of types,
especially when inheritance is involved.

If the signature were just `<T extends Comparable<T>>`, it would fail in cases like this:

```java
class Animal implements Comparable<Animal> { ... }
class Dog extends Animal { ... }

List<Dog> dogs = new ArrayList<>();
Collections.sort(dogs); // works with Comparable<? super T>
```

This works because `Dog` is a subtype of `Animal`,
and `Animal` implements `Comparable<Animal>`.  
Using `? super T` ensures that this kind of relationship is allowed.

This design helps make the `sort()` method compatible with a wider range of
types in real-world code.

You can read a much more in-depth explanation of Generics in the Java documentation
if you are interested. A tutorial is also available
[here](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/index.html).

> Under the hood, Java generics use a technique called **type erasure**.

> So while generics give us type safety at compile time,
> the JVM doesn't retain generic type information at runtime — it just sees
> regular classes and `Object` references.
> This is why you can't do things like `new T()` or check `instanceof T` — the
